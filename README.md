## Quantitative finance with python

Published code herein, _tech_anal.py_ is an **ADAPTED** script from the codes from Ives Hilpish's book _**Python for Finance**_ which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks.

The figures showed herein are the results of an optimization script _vicious_gnauga.py_ which integrates _tech_anal.py_ to a [secret] Monte Carlo algorithm (not pushed here; confidential) which finds optimal backtesting parameters for a certain stock, showing optimal buy-hold-sell regimes for the historical period (step-wise line in red) through limited knowledge of future values.
