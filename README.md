## backtest_simple.py

Published code _**backtest_simple.py**_ is an **ADAPTED** script from the scripts in _**Python for Finance (Yves Hilpisch, 2014)**_ which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks. The algorithm has been adapted to import historical data from the web through *working* APIs as the Yahoo API (in Yves' 2014 book) has been deprecated. I have also recently added cryptocurrencies-importing capabilities from Binance (_**binancereader.py**_) and plotly publishing functionality.
