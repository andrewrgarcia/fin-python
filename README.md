## blackswanclimb.py

[in .gitignore] _**blackswanclimb.py**_ is an optimization script which integrates _**backtest_simple.py**_ to a brute force Monte Carlo method (not pushed here; confidential) which finds optimal backtesting parameters for a certain stock, indicating **"BUY/HOLD/SELL"** regimes for a certain trading window.
