## Quantitative finance with python

Published code herein, _tech_anal.py_ is a script with adapted codes from Ives Hilpish's book _*Python for Finance*_ which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks. The figures showed herein are the results of an optimization program which integrate tech_anal.py to a [secret] Monte Carlo algorithm which I will not push. Algorithms are backtesting of stock data and could potentially be used to optimize returns.
