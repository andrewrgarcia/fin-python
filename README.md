Published code _**tech_anlsys.py**_ is an **ADAPTED** script from the codes from _**Python for Finance (Yves Hilpisch, 2014)**_ which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks.

The figures showed here are the results of an optimization script _**cerberus33.py**_ which integrates _**tech_anlsys.py**_ to a [secret] Monte Carlo algorithm (not pushed here; confidential) which finds optimal backtesting parameters for a certain stock, showing optimal **"BUY/HOLD/SELL"** regimes (step-wise red line in 2nd plot) for a certain trading window.
