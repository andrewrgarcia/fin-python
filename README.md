Quantitative finance with python.

Published code herein, tech_anal.py is a script with adapted codes from Ives Hilpish's book "Python for Finance" which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks. The figures showed herein are the results of an optimization program which integrate tech_anal.py to a [secret] Monte Carlo algorithm which I will not push. Algorithms are backtesting of stock data and could potentially be used to optimize returns.
