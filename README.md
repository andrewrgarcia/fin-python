## Quantitative finance with python

Published code _**tech_anlsys.py**_ is an **ADAPTED** script from the codes from _**Python for Finance (Yves Hilpisch, 2014)**_ which show simple technical analysis algorithms for stocks.

The figures showed here are the results of an optimization script _**vicious_gnaugas.py**_ which integrates _**tech_anlsys.py**_ to a [secret] Monte Carlo algorithm (not pushed here; confidential) which finds optimal backtesting parameters for a certain stock, showing optimal buy-hold-sell regimes for the historical period (step-wise line in red) through limited knowledge of future values.
